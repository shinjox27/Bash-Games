# Coinflip-for-Bash
Heads or tails Coinflipping game for BASH
It's an something I like to call a practice project.
I took a sample script from this web page https://code.snipcademy.com/tutorials/shell-scripting/control-flow/if-then-else-fi 
and modified it with a highscore feature which I took from a back of the first issue Capital F Magizine by Brian Lunduke.
http://capitalf.org/
https://github.com/brendangregg/GuessingGame#
It wasn't just copy and pasting I did have to modify the sample script from snipcademy to exit on loses and not generate a highscore entry.
That being said you the user of this script accepts 100% Ownership of every copy that you the user may choice to download.
I offer no warenties or support if you change something and it breaks the script nor under any circumstance.
I give 100% premission to sell this script as free software as in the terms of the GPL 3.0
